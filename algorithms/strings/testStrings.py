in 1951, eugene kolkey, an accomplished graphic artist and art director for leo burnett, sketched a character for a contest to become the official mascot of a kellogg's brand-new breakfast cereal. kolkey designed a tiger named tony (named after an ad man at leo burnettâ€”raymond anthony wells[1]) and selected martin provensen for the finished artwork. tony competed against three other potential mascots for the public's affection: katy the kangaroo (originated by robert dulaney in the early fifties), elmo the elephant, and newt the gnu.[2] within the year, the other mascots were dropped (with elmo and newt never once gracing the front of the box), and tony was given a son, tony jr. tony the tiger would eventually become a cereal icon. the final tony the tiger design came from a group of former disney animators known as quartet films, which also designed the jolly green giant, snap crackle pop, the hamms beer bear, and the baltimore orioles mascot, among others. stan walsh, art babbitt, arnold gillesspie, and michael lah were the artists/filmmakers that formed the quartet films of hollywood
